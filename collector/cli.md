# Command line Interface (CLI)

The collector provides a command line interface, which helps in some tasks:

* Listing the available objects and curves on the remote WITSML store
* Listing available tags on the remote OPC store
* Exporting historical data (part or all) from the remote WITSML store and sending it to INTELIE Live (or just saving it on local files)

After the collector is installed, the CLI binary is added to the local path.

For more details, just run:

```
liverig-cli --help
```
