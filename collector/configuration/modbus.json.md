For a modbus source to be normalized by INTELIE Live, two files are needed to be configured, the [sources.xml](./sources.xml.md) and the `modbus.json`. The specific setting about a modbus source can be found at the [modbus protocol page](./../protocols/modbus.md). Following the example at the modbus protocol page, two `<request>` objects need to be mapped on the following JSON format (`modbus.json`).&#x20;

## LiveRig Collector 5.0.0 or above

```json
{
  "version": "2.0",

    "pump-pressure-1": [

        "alias": ["rotary_pump_pressure", "rotation_max_pressure", "hold_back_pressure"]
      },
      {
        "type": "discrete-input",
        "start_address": 5,
        "count": 2,

      }
    ],
    "water-flow-1": [

      },
      {
        "type": "coil",
        "start_address": 3
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Each controller in the field `controllers` represents a device defined on [sources.xml](./sources.xml.md) at `<request>/<object>` and it describes all
memory areas that will be fetched. Each memory area has the following fields:

| Name          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Is required? | Default value                                                                                                                         |

| dataType      | The data type to parse the values returned by the Modbus source. *See more info below*                                                                                                                                                                                                         |      No      | If the register type is `coil` or `discrete-input`, the default dataType will be `boolean`. Otherwise the default dataType is `int16` |

### Data Types

The `dataType` field from the `modbus.json` file can have the following options on the `modbus.json` file:

- Single Register:
    - `boolean` (1 bit)
    - `int8` (8 bits)
    - `uint8` (8 bits)
    - `byte` (8 bits)
    - `int16` (16 bits)
    - `uint16` (16 bits)
    - `word` (16 bits)
    - `char` (8 bits)
    - `wchar` (16 bits)

- Double Register (32 bits):
    - `int32`
    - `uint32`
    - `float`
    - `word32`

- Quadruple Register (64 bits):
    - `int64`
    - `uint64`
    - `double`
    - `word64`

Using a data type that requires more than 1 register will disable the `count` feature declared at the `modbus.json`
file.

You don't need to declare a count if using Multi-register data types, we will assume it is always the next address.
Example:
If the dataType is `int32` and the `start_address` is `123`, the LiveRig Collector will fetch the values from
addresses `123` and `124` to form the `int32` (long) value.

### Aliases

The `alias` field from the `modbus.json` file is an array of strings. That means that you can allocate more than 1 alias
to a memory area.
If that is the case the alias will be applied by the following rule:
For each address fetched by the memory area, we will apply the alias from the list using the order of both.

**Example 1:**
*If a memory area has a `start_address` set as `123` and a `count` set as `3`, the end result will be values from
addresses `123`, `124` and `125`. If the `alias` field has just the value `["exampeAlias"]`, then the LiveRig Collector
will map `exampeAlias_123` to address `123`, `exampeAlias_124` to address `124` and `exampeAlias_125` to address `125`.*

**Example 2:**
*If a memory area has a `start_address` set as `123` and a `count` set as `3`, the end result will be values from
addresses `123`, `124` and `125`. If the `alias` field has the value `["exampleAlias1", "exampleAlias2", "exampleAlias3"
]`, then the LiveRig Collector will map `exampleAlias1` to address `123`, `exampleAlias2` to address `124` and
`exampleAlias3` to address `125`.*

**Example 3:**
*If a memory area has a `start_address` set as `123` and a `count` set as `3`, the end result will be values from
addresses `123`, `124` and `125`. If the `alias` field has the value `["exampleAlias1", "exampleAlias2", "exampleAlias3"
, "exampleAlias4"]`, then the LiveRig Collector will map `exampeAlias_123` to address `123`, `exampeAlias_124` to
address `124` and `exampeAlias_125` to address `125`. The `exampleAlias4` will not be used as a channel rename.*

**Note:**
If there is fewer aliases than the address count (the alias list has a size of `2` and the count of addresses is `4`),
the
LiveRig Collector will raise an exception, since it won't know how to map the aliases to each address.

## LiveRig Collector 4.x or bellow

```json

  "controllers": {
    "pump-pressure-1": {
      "input-register" : {
        "start_address": 0,

Each `controller` represents a device defined on [sources.xml](./sources.xml.md) at `<request>/<object>` and describe all memory areas that will be fetched. For each memory area (such as `input-register,` `discrete-input`, `coil` or `holding-register`), the following information must be provided:&#x20;

| Name           | Description                                                                                        | Is required? | Default value |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|---------------|

| count          | Represents the number of registers or coils that will be read sequentially from the start\_address | No           | 0             |
| unit           | The unit of measurement to be used in INTELIE Live                                                 | No           |               |
