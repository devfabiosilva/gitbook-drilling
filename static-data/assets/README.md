# Assets

The static data is organized in assets. The base asset types for drilling are the `Well`, the `Rig`, and the `Intervention`. Each of them has its own structure, which you can find on the next pages.

All the data related to an asset is versioned. It is possible to restore any previously saved version, as the image below shows. The versions can work both as project information and execution data.
