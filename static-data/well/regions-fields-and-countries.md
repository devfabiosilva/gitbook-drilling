# Regions, fields and countries

INTELIE Live enables the management of fields, regions, and countries. It is possible to use a default set, provided out-of-the-box.

It is possible to configure location for each well:

![Location country and region of a well](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (155).png>)

It is possible to configure custom regions with specific countries and fields.&#x20;

More details [here](../../administration/static-data/regions-fields-and-countries.md).
