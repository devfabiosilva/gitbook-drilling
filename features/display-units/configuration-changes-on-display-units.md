description: User input defining min/max are also converted by the unit sets mechanism.

# Configuration changes on unit sets

When users set **Axis min** or **Axis max** using a chart provided by [Data visualization](../data-visualization/channels-charts/#temporal-channels-chart) it will be converted to the current active unit for the channel, either if input when display unit is active and removed afterwards or vice-versa.

A warning icon will appear, the example is the conversion of 100bbl (input) to Litre
