# Depth unit changes

After identifying the hole depth channel using the [Standard Identifiers](../../administration/standard-identifiers.md), display units configured to it will also convert the index of the current chart, example:\

Notice that the screenshot below does not have unit set applied

![No unit set](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (514).png>)

Same data, with display unit applied, note that hole depth was converted from **meter** to **foot**.\
