# Unit Conversion

The unit sets allow an easy configuration per asset and that relies on the capabilities for unit management, see more details about unit conversions at [Unit Management Tools](../../administration/high-frequency-data/unit-management-tools.md).

### Asset-based unit conversion

If a previous value was defined in a field of asset, Live will convert the value to the target unit of associated unit set. Example of well converting units from meters to ft:
