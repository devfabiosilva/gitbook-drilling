# Well casing shoe schematic

{% hint style="info" %}
plugin-casing-shoe 1.2.0 and plugin-wells 4.0.0 minimum versions required
{% endhint %}

The casing shoe schematic chart provides a visualization of the transversal section of a well, illustrating the well construction and previewing the bit depth position in real time. The schematic shows casing structures such as liners, slotted liners, lithology, target formations by depth of the casing string.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The casing-shoe chart consumes static data from well design overview information at the well parameters tab and the bit depth real time standard channel
{% endhint %}

Static data used to render the casing shoe schematic at well parameters tab:

Advantages **:**\\

***

* Preview well design phase information such as casing diameters, bit depth, lithology, and target formations, and casing structure including liners, screen, slotted liners or open hole by depth
* Go along with the real time bit depth position using the standard configured channel
* Use well casing shoe chart for different wells with dashboards filters or a predefined well
* Plan ahead knowing where it is advantageous to set the casing, defining where important formations are located

To include the chart go to edit mode at the dashboard and the option for casing shoe schematic widget will be available:

It is possible configure the chart to select the well by available wells list or with dashboard filter:

Also it is possible to configure which visualization will be displayed at the dashboard and the section details at long or short format:

If the configuration is selected with dashboard filter it is possible to select the asset at the dashboard:

To show the bit position in real time the bit depth standard channel must be configured and with the data management enabled for the used well:

Then by hovering the mouse over the bit it will show the depth position:

It is possible to configure the objectives at the well parameters tab to preview by depth in the chart:

If the well is configured as onshore the surface is displayed instead of water depth:

It is possible to configure a well design to compare execution and planned well schematic versions:
