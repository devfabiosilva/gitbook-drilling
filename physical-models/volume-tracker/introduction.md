# Introduction

Summary:

* Given a well geometry and fluids pumping sequence this module will keep track of the fluid's location along the pipe and annular region, supporting multiple entries in the pumping sequence and multiple fluid entry/exit points (main inlet at surface, boosters, circulation loss for formation)
* This module currently only supports mud weight configuration for the fluid, where in future releases it will fully support rheology and other fluid parameters.
